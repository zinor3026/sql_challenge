# SQL-challenge
Module 9 Challenge
## Description:
Background: Itâ€™s been two weeks since you were hired as a new data engineer at Pewlett Hackard (a fictional company). Your first major task is to do a research project about people whom the company employed during the 1980s and 1990s. All that remains of the employee database from that period are six CSV files.

For this project, I have designed the tables to hold the data from the CSV files, imported the CSV files into a SQL database, and then answered some questions about the data. The questions can be found in the Analysis file.
 ## Installations
 I used QuickDBD for the ERD and PosgreSQL pgadmin4.
 ## Other Instructions:
 You can find all the files in the folder EmployeeSQL.
 The schema was first created using QuickDBD and later modified on SQL to avoid errors.
 ## Contributing
 Almost all problems are solved with the help of the activities and the codes used during the class.
 Special thanks to our TA Joseph Ng for helping me debug my error. Googled the code EXTRACT and its usage.
